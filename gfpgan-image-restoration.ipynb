It leverages the generative face prior in a pre-trained GAN to restore realistic faces while preserving fidelity.\n\nBlind face restoration aims at recovering high-quality faces from the low-quality counterparts suffering from unknown degradation, such as low-resolution, noise, blur, compression artifacts, etc.\n\nThis Generative Facial Prior (GFP) is incorporated into the face restoration process via channel-split spatial feature transform layers, which allow for a good balance between realness and fidelity\nIf you want to use the paper model, [please go to this Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Oa1WwKB4M4l1GmR7CtswDVgOCOeSLChA?usp=sharing) for GFPGAN google colab logo.\n\n📝 𝗣𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿:\nhttps://lnkd.in/gMRk226Z","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rm -rf GFPGAN\n!git clone https://github.com/j0rd4n93/GFPGAN.git\n%cd GFPGAN\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# train_images = train_data[\"image\"].progress_apply(load_image, args=((100,100),))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-21T17:46:41.195188Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-21T17:46:41.196224Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-21T17:46:41.20103Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-21T17:46:41.196195Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-21T17:46:41.200044Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Now we use the GFPGAN to restore the above low-quality images\n# We use [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) for enhancing the background (non-face) regions\n!rm -rf results\n!python inference_gfpgan.py -i inputs/proyecto/upload/4501-5000/ -o results -v 1.4 -s 2\n\n!ls results/cmp","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-26T21:38:52.025644Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-26T21:38:52.026047Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-26T21:38:52.025828Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-26T21:38:52.025851Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rm -rf \n!pip install files\nimport os\nimport files\n# download the result\n!ls results\nprint('Download results')\nos.system('zip -r download.zip results')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-26T17:24:45.026031Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-26T17:24:45.026797Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-26T17:25:23.462214Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-26T17:24:45.026756Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-26T17:25:23.461071Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
